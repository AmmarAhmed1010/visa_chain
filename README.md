# VisaChain - Blockchain-Powered Embassy Visa Appointment System

## Overview

VisaChain is a revolutionary blockchain-based solution designed to eliminate the black market for embassy visa appointments. By leveraging smart contracts, NFTs, and identity verification, we ensure fair and transparent access to visa appointments for everyone.

## The Problem

- **Bot Domination**: Automated bots book appointments in bulk within seconds
- **Black Market Resale**: Brokers resell appointments at 10x the original price
- **Extreme Delays**: Students, workers, and families face 1-2 year delays
- **Lack of Transparency**: No visibility into the booking process

## Our Solution

- **Blockchain Transparency**: All bookings recorded on immutable blockchain
- **Identity Verification**: KYC integration ensures only verified users can book
- **NFT Appointments**: Each slot is a unique, non-transferable NFT
- **Smart Contracts**: Automated enforcement of fair booking rules
- **Anti-Bot Measures**: Multiple layers of protection against automated systems
